ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Keegan Heffernan. I'm a Front End Developer based out of Kingston, Ontario and I love to learn and code! 
I have experience with many different programming languages such as PHP, Javascript, MySQL, Java, C++, C#, Python, and many more!

Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS to better improve my web development skills and to open up a whole new world of possibilities for my career.
I'm learning ReactJS through a very interesting course called "The front end developer's career path" provided by Scrimba. It features over 1000 lessons,
hundreds of hours of interactive videos and challenges, and teaches everything somebody would need to know about web development from basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and UI design all the way to advanced ReactJS applications. I'm happy to say I've progressed to the last few (but most difficult) modules and am on my way to learning React!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Keegan Heffernan. I'm a Front End Developer based out of Kingston, Ontario and I love to learn and code! 
I have experience with many different programming languages such as PHP, Javascript, MySQL, Java, C++, C#, Python, and many more!

Iâ€™m currently learning ReactJS to better improve my web development skills and to open up a whole new world of possibilities for my career.
I'm learning ReactJS through a very interesting course called "The front end developer's career path" provided by Scrimba. It features over 1000 lessons,
hundreds of hours of interactive videos and challenges, and I'm happy to say I've made it to the last few modules!

If you're interested in contacting me you can do so through my LinkedIn account <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/keegan-heffernan/">here</a>.
